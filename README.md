Monitor Wi-Fi at Cafes
======================

Scripts to help monitor and enable Wi-Fi at cafes.

I was at Pickle & Fig TTDI and found that their Wi-Fi would disconnect every few mins.
And you have to constantly re-enable the Wi-Fi by watching their advertisement.

So I made this script to automate this for me.

I didn't manage to test it much since the Wi-Fi stopped working after a while.
